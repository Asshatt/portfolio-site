			<p>
				Hi, I'm Jeremy,
				<br><br>
				I am an aspiring game developer specializing in Gameplay and UX programming and design. 
				I was born and raised in the Philippines and I'm currently based in Redmond, Washington, 
				hoping to bring a fresh cultural perspective into the industry.
				<br><br>
				I am studying at the DigiPen Institute of Technology for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science 
				and Game Design, and I'm currently on track to graduate in 2026.
				<br><br>
				I am most adept in programming and designing core gameplay systems and mechanics, 
				as well as creating and maintaining tools to streamline the development process.
				<br><br>
				I also have skills in other areas such as sound design, music composition, 3D art and animation, and writing. 
				If it's part of the game development process, I would surely have some experience in it.
				<br><br>
				I have a deep interest in video games as an art form, especially the interaction of storytelling with the 
				dynamics of gameplay and how they evoke emotions that enhance human connections. It is my goal to push 
				the art form forward through my work.

		<div class="Content base">
			<p>
				During my internship with Taktyl Studios, I was tasked with creating a prototype for a 
				character action game in Unreal Engine. This prototype was made to help pitch a video game 
				based on an award winning Filipino graphic novel, and was also to be included as part 
				of an initiative towards preserving the national martial art of Arnis.

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				I was responsible for programming the core functionality of the game and piecing together the
				whole prototype using guidelines, design documents, and art assets provided to me by the studio. 
				<br><br>
				For this prototype I implemented:
			</p>			
			<ul>
				<li>player locomotion with the ability to walk, sprint, jump, and vault over ledges</li>
				<li>combat with light and heavy attacks and a variety of special moves</li>
				<li>enemy AI using behavior trees with attacks controlled via animation notifies</li>
				<li>a global enemy encounter controller and token system to control encounter difficulty</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I paid attention to code cleanliness throughout this project, and also focused a large part of 
				my efforts on implementing features in ways that could easily be modified by designers without
				having to interface directly with implementation.
				<br><br>
				As mentioned above, attacks are handled via animation notifies that can be attached
				directly to the enemy and player attack montages. This system allows for designers to easily
				modify variables like an attack's damage and range without having to directly open an enemy's
				blueprint class. Being attached directly as an animation notify also allows for precise timing
				with animations that can easily be modified in the event that an attack animation is replaced or
				retimed in some way.
				<br><br>
				Player attack combos are also stored in a tree styled data structure with each attack having references
				to various "next" attacks depending on the next player input. This system was made to enable designers
				to easily create and modify different combo strings of heavy and light attacks plus pause combos 
				without having to directly deal with the underlying blueprints.
				<br><br>
				I designed everything this way so that, in the event that the project gets greenlit, this prototype could
				be used as a workable base for other programmers and designers to work off of.

				Throughout the project, I communicated with a designer to ensure an overall level of quality
				and adherence to the requirements. I was also monitored closely by higher-ups in the studio
				to ensure a consistent rate of progress over the time that I had to create the prototype.

			<p>
				HexenHold is a tower defense game where players defend an evil necromancer against ghosts 
				and monsters as they try to disrupt the ritual. The game fuses tower defense gameplay with 
				platforming elements, requiring players to run and jump around the stage placing towers and 
				throwing enemies away from the necromancer.
				<br><br>
				I worked on this game as a member of Hazard Stripes Productions, an interdisciplinary team formed 
				during my sophomore game class. A large part of my time was spent working and communicating with designers, 
				and figuring out ways to make our engine tools more robust and accessible to allow for their expertise to 
				truly shine. This project greatly helped my development both as a programmer, and as a team player.

				</div>
			</div>
			
			<p>
				HexenHold was developed using a custom engine written in C++ and utilizing OpenGL for graphics rendering. The engine 
				made use of the ECS architectural pattern, where components are stored in individual cache coherent containers and 
				read by systems that governed all functionality in the engine. This was done for learning purposes, as well as to
				improve performance to facilitate the large waves of enemies typically expected of a tower defense game.

			<div class = "MultiImageContainer">
				<img src="images/hexenhold_gameplay.gif">
				<img src="images/hexenhold_1.jpg">
			</div>

			<p>
				I programmed the OpenGL 3.3 graphics backend using GLFW. The engine can display, rotate, and scale textured quads and 
				has support for additive blending for certain lighting effects. I also implemented various structures to contain and 
				serialize sprite data in order to make modifying and interfacing with this backend as user friendly as possible.
				<br><br>
				I also created a basic in-game ImGui editor with the ability to move and spawn entities on command, and modify specific 
				entity attributes on the fly. This was created to help programmers and designers iterate on ideas faster without having
				to modify the engine code.
			</p>

			<div class="CenteredImageContainer">
				<img src="images/hexenhold_editor.gif" >
			</div>
			
			<p>
				I implemented a frame based animation system to allow for easier implementation of spritesheet based animations. 
				Animation data is serialized in JSON format to allow for ease of use.
				<br><br>
				Using this implementation, I created a proper animation editor that allowed designers to create and edit animation 
				timings while previewing them in real-time. This editor took a lot of inspiration from the Unity animation editor,
				as it was what our designers were most accustomed to at the time. Over the course of the project, I updated and
				mantained this editor, modify and adding featurees according to feedback from the team's animator and sprite artist.

				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				I implemented an enemy wave editor to allow our systems designer to more easily iterate on the balance of enemy 
				encounters in levels without having to directly interface with JSON files.
				<br><br>
				I also implemented Tiled integration, allowing levels created in Tiled to be exported as JSON files and read into 
				the engine as level data. the engine supports placement of background tiles, color tints and parallax for individual 
				layers, and the placement of entities into the level using Object Layers.
				<br><br>
				These features allowed our level and systems designers to more easily create and iterate on levels.
			</p>

			<div class="CenteredImageContainer">
				<img src="images/hexenhold_tiled.png">
			</div>

			<p>
				I implemented a lot of other miscellaneous systems for the engine, most notably a basic "tagging" system which allowed 
				for strings to be attached to individual entities, which proved quite useful for implementing things like filtered 
				collisions and projectile targeting.
				<br><br>
				I worked on other gameplay related functionality such as player control, enemy behaviors, and throwing interactions 
				alongside our other gameplay programmer.
				<br><br>
				In addition, I handled implementation of the in-game tutorial to the custom engine, porting over functionality from 
				the rough prototype created by the designers.
				<br><br>
				I also handled the implementation of a number of menu interfaces throughout the game, such as the in-game pause menu, 
				and options menu.
				<br><br>
				I was the one responsible for editing together the game's trailer video, and also took it upon myself to compose all 
				the original music heard in-game and in the trailer.
				<br><br>
				For the steam version of the game, I primarily worked on implementing controller support.

				This game was developed in Unreal Engine 5. This project is more narrative driven than most of my

				I worked on this game for my junior game project alongside a team of 12 designers, artists, and other programmers.
				<br><br>
				I implemented a lot of the core mechanics of the game including the sanity/health mechanic that relies on light, and 
				the basic stamina mechanics.
				<br><br>
				I also created a large portion of the player controller, with major functionality being controlled using C++. 
				<br><br>
				I collaborated heavily with our AI programmer to implement new gameplay features to the monster such as the ability to hear sounds 
				from the player or the environment and  immediately moves towards them to investigate. I added in a throwable item mechanic to 
				allow players to utilize this aspect of the monster to their advantage by making a sound to get it to move out of the way.
				<br><br>
				I was responsible for implementing many UX improvements based on playtester feedback, such as a light in the eyes of the monster that 
				shows its cone of vision, and changes color when it sees the player.
			</p>
			<div class = "MultiImageContainer">
				<img src="images/tcas_chase.gif">
				<img src="images/tcas_hide.gif">
			</div>
			<p>
				I also implemented the point and click puzzle interface that facilitates much of the game's progression. It interfaces with the player's 
				inventory, dynamically showing and hiding individual pieces depending on collected items. The system was designed to be inuitive for 
				designers to work with, with movable pieces having a "key" attached which has a corresponding "lock" on a slot. If all keys are in 
				the right place, the puzzle is registered as solved. This allowed for our designers to quickly conceptualize, implement, and iterate 
				on different puzzle concepts. 
				<br><br>
				I implemented a myriad of menus for the purposes of player experience including the inventory checklist screen, the dynamic map screen 
				with fog of war, the note glossary, and others, in collaboration with the team's artists and UX designer to ensure a high level of 
				quality and usability. 
			</p>
			<div class = "MultiImageContainer">
				<img src="images/tcas_map.png">
				<img src="images/tcas_inventory.png">
			</div>
			<p>
				Early in development, the design called for the ability to carry and drop items across levels to solve puzzles. To achieve this without 
				making too many changes to our designers' workflow, I created a scene persistence system which could save relevant actor data for each 
				level upon exiting, and load that data when re-entering the same room. This allowed the player to hold onto and move puzzle related 
				items and keys around rooms without losing progress. The system also allowed for items to be brought between different levels to 
				enable designers to create more complex puzzles that would require bringing physics objects back and forth between areas of the map. 
				The system was designed to require as little manual input as possible, allowing designers and artists to create props and puzzles 
				without having to worry too much about the underlying functionality. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to my role as a programmer, I was also the game's Audio Lead and the sole sound designer of the team. All the game's sound 
				effects and ambience were mixed and mastered by me. I composed most of the music in the game, consisting currently of the title track, 
				game over theme, and monster chase theme. I also arranged the credits song in collaboration with our producer. 
				<br><br>
				I am particularly proud of the final chase sequence, for which I did both the programming and sound design for, and collaborated closely 
				with our environment artists to conceptualize and bring to life.

				I created this mostly as a passion project, and to refine my skills as a solo developer after 
				primarily working on team projects for two years. I was inspired by games that I had been playing 
				at the time, and with nothing to do over the summer, thought to try and see how my skills had 
				improved since I started college.<br><br>
				
				I also took it as an opportunity to better learn the Godot Engine, a project that I had been keeping 
				an eye on for a while. I believe this project helped bolster my general confidence and skill in all 
				aspects of game development and reignited my passion for creative expression through games.
			</p>

			<div class="CenteredImageContainer base">
				<img src="images/topdowncombat_1.png">
			</div>

			<p>
				As this was a solo project, I was responsible for all aspects of development.
				<br><br>
				As the focus was on melee combat, I made sure to implement attacks and damage to be as modular as possible. 
				All attacks are stored as custom resources (the Godot equivalent to Unity's serialized objects) that contain 
				stats like damage, knockback, and ideal distance, and a reference to an animation to play on the attached actor. 
				The actual triggering of attacks as well as cooldown timing is handled using the animation system, which allowed 
				for me to precisely time frame data to animations. These attack objects are placed in a "combo" container, which 
				allows for easy sequencing of attacks to be used both by the player and enemies. This system allowed me to easily 
				iterate on enemy behaviors, as creating new attacks and modifying existing ones was as easy as changing some values 
				in the inspector.
				<br><br>
				Enemy AI is handled as a finite state machine, with enemies switching between getting in range of the player and 
				executing attacks. Enemies store a weighted table of attack patterns that can be edited in the inspector.
				<br><br>
				For testing purposes, I also implemented a basic telemetry system, tracking the time and specific events relevant to 
				gameplay. This system allowed me to more quantifiably gauge things like which encounters players would get stuck on or 
				spend too much time in, as well as diagnose any potential bugs if the data doesn't seem to behave as intended.
				<br><br>
				I made a point to focus on the user experience, adding in features like hitstop and dynamic camera zooms to make combat feel 
				as satisfying as possible.
				<br><br>
				I created all character and monster designs, as well as all art assets used in the game. I made use of Blender to model and 
				animate 3D characters and environments to speed up the development process, and rendered them as low resolution sprites with an 
				amount of color filtering applied to achieve my desired art style. I also made significant use of Godot's 2D lighting system to 
				provide a more atmospheric and dynamic feel to the visuals.
				<br><br>
				I composed and mixed the background music used in the demo, making use of an array of free VSTs to achieve my desired sound.
